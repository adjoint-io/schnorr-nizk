The purpose of the Schnorr protocol is to allow one to prove the knowledge of a discrete logarithm without revealing its value.

## Schnorr Identification Scheme

The Schnorr protocol is an example of a Sigma protocol (<img src="/tex/813cd865c037c89fcdc609b25c465a05.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=11.87217899999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>-protocol).  A
Sigma protocol is a three-step protocol in which communication between prover
and verifier goes forwards once, then backwards, then forwards again.  In
general terms:

- `P  ->  V`:  commitment
- `V  ->  P`:  challenge
- `P  ->  V`:  response (proof)

The protocol is defined for a cyclic group of order `n`.

The prover aims to convince the verifier that he knows some private value `a`. Therefore, `P = G * [a]`**[1]** will be her public key. In order to prove knowledge of it, the prover interacts with the verifier in three passes:

- The prover commits to a random private value `v`, chosen in the range `[1, n-1]`. This is the first message `commitment = G * [v]`.

- The verifier replies with a `challenge` chosen at random from `[0, 2^t - 1]`.

- After receiving the `challenge`, the prover sends the third and last message (the response) `resp = (v - challenge * a) mod n`.

The verifier accepts, if:
- The prover's public key, `P`, is a valid public key. It means that it must be a valid point on the curve and `P * [h]` is not a point at infinity, where `h` is the cofactor of the curve.

- The prover's commitment value is equal to `G * [r] + P * [challenge]`

## Zero Knowledge Proofs

Zero knowledge proofs are a way by which one party succeeds in convincing another party that she knows a private value x without exposing any information apart from the fact that she knows the value x.

All proof systems have two requirements:

- **Completeness**: An honest verifier will be convinced of this fact by an untrusted prover.

- **Soundness**: No prover, even if it doesn't follow the protocol, can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability.

It is assumed that the verifier is always honest.

## Schnorr NIZK proof

The original Schnorr identification scheme is made non-interactive through a Fiat-Shamir transformation, assuming that there exists a secure cryptographic hash function (i.e., the so-called random oracle model).

An oracle is considered to be a black box that outputs unpredictable but deterministic random values in response to a certain input. That means that, given the same input, the oracle will give back the same random output. The input to the random oracle, in the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, is specifically the transcript of the interaction up to that point. The challenge is then redefined as `challenge = H(g || V || A)`, where `H` is a secure cryptographic hash function like SHA-256. The bit length of the hash output should be at least equal to that of the order `n` of the considered subgroup.

An example of the Schnorr protocol for Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs looks as follows.

```haskell

testSchnorrNIZK :: IO Bool
testSchnorrNIZK = do
  -- Setup
  let curveName = Curve25519
      basePoint = Curve.g curveName
  keyPair@(pk, sk) <- genKeys curveName basePoint

  -- Prover
  proof <- Schnorr.prove curveName basePoint keyPair

  -- Verifier
  pure $ Schnorr.verify curveName basePoint pk proof

```

## Curves

This Schnorr implementation offers support for both SECp256k1 and Curve25519 curves,
which are Koblitz and Montgomery curves, respectively.
